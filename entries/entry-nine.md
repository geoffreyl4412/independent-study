# Entry Nine:

In this week, I make my MVPresentation and make some edits to my MVProduct.

## The MVPresentation

Well, I made a presentation, and I think I covered the important things in it. I didn't have any time to practice, however. I made myself a script of what I am going to say, but I don't want to rely on that during the presentation. Let's see if I can just *wing it*.

## Changes to the MVProduct

I made some changes to my app like adding a note and changing the font because I thought they would look better when I present.

## Takeaways

1. *Make some time to practice your presentation.*
2. *Be proud of what you made.*
